# About

This is a simple todolsit app to explore a MERN stack and writting multiple APIs

## Improvements

If done again it would ideally just use one API to write to the Database. Using the priciple of immutability a copy of the todos would be created and this would be used to replace the existing table in mongodb. This would be controlled using a single useEffect with the todos inside the dependacy array.

## Setup

1. add .env file
2. `npm install` in both the client and backend
3. `npm start` in both the client and backend
